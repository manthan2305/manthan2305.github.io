Hi, I'm Manthan, a passionate software engineer and machine learning researcher currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science (Autonomous Systems) at the [University of Stuttgart, Germany](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/). My journey in AI and robotics is fueled by a deep curiosity for developing intelligent systems that interact seamlessly with the real world.

I'm always excited about collaborations, research opportunities, and challenging technical problems. Let’s connect and build something amazing together!
