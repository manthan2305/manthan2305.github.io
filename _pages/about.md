Hi, I'm a software engineer and machine learning researcher currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science (Autonomous Systems) at the [University of Stuttgart, Germany](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/). 

I specialize in building end-to-end machine learning systems with expertise in diffusion models, large language model fine-tuning, and RAG-based solutions. My work spans the complete ML pipeline from research and development to deployment and scaling.

#### Hobby Projects:

Learning, building and sharing at [Codust.dev](https://codust.dev)

Developing LLM based accounting autoamtion tool [Kuber.so](https://kuber.so)
